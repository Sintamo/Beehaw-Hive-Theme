# Beehaw Hive Theme

My attempt at a user-installable theme for [Beehaw](beehaw.org).

Available in both light and dark flavors, the Hive Theme intends to create an intuitive, pleasing and clean bee-centric theme for the Beehaw instance of Lemmy.

# Installation

- Install [Stylebot](https://stylebot.dev/) - this was the only CSS extension I found that worked reliably across browsers and consistently applied settings. YMMV with other extensions - Stylus just didn't work well for me.
- Check your Beehaw settings and select "darkly" if you want to use Hive Dark, and "litely" if you want to use Hive Light
- Copy and paste the contents of either Hive_Light_Theme.css or Hive_Dark_Theme.css from my Github into the "code" section of Stylebot
- Et Viol√†!

It is currently compatible with version 0.17.4 of Lemmy, with a 0.18.0 compatible theme planned for the near future.

Fair warning: I'm a Product Designer, not a programmer, so don't judge the code too harshly. Remember, be(e) kind ;)
