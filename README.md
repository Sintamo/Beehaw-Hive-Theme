# Beehaw Hive Theme

My attempt at a user-installable theme for [Beehaw](beehaw.org).

Available in both light and dark flavors, the Hive Theme intends to create an intuitive, pleasing and clean bee-centric theme for the Beehaw instance of Lemmy.

It is currently compatible with version 0.17.4 of Lemmy, with a 0.18.0 compatible theme planned for the near future.

Fair warning: I'm a Product Designer, not a programmer, so don't judge the code too harshly. Remember, be(e) kind ;)
